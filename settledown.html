<h2>Lyrics</h2>
<pre>
    A soft sound
    Into the way that she wears her hair down
    Covering up her face
    And oh what a let down
    And I don't seem to be having any effect now
    Falling all over the place
    But you're losing your words
    We're speaking in bodies
    Avoiding me and talking 'bout you
    But you're losing your turn
    I guess I'll never learn
    'Cause I stay another hour or two
    For crying out loud, settle down!
    You know I can't be found with you
    We get back to my house
    Your hands, my mouth
    Now I just stop myself around you
    A small town
    Dictating all the people we get around
    What a familiar face
    Do you get what I mean now?
    I'm so fixated on the girl with the soft sound
    Her hair all over the place
    And you're sure that I'd learn
    I'm pushing through bodies
    Avoiding me and walking 'round you
    And you're cold and I burn
    I guess I'll never learn
    'Cause I stay another hour or two
    For crying out loud, settle down!
    You know I can't be found with you
    We get back to my house
    Your hands, my mouth
    Now I just stop myself around you
    A soft sound
    Into the way that she wears her hair down
    Covering up her face
    And oh what a let down
    I don't seem to be having any effect now
    Falling all over the place
    But you're losing your words
    We're speaking in bodies
    Avoiding me and talking 'bout you
    And you're losing your turn
    I guess I'll never learn
    'Cause I stay another hour or two
    For crying out loud, settle down!
    You know I can't be found with you
    We get back to my house
    Your hands, my mouth
    Now I just stop myself around you
    For crying out loud!
